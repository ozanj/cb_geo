# result: if the geometry of a census tract overlaps with more than one eps geometry, that census tract appears multiple times
  # what chat gpt says    
    # Yes, in the solution you've implemented, a given census tract will appear once if it is wholly contained within a single geomarket and will appear multiple times if it intersects with multiple geomarkets. Each appearance represents an intersection with a different geomarket.
    #Wholly Contained Tracts: If a census tract is entirely within a single geomarket, it will appear once in the joined dataframe with that geomarket's eps code.
    #Intersecting Tracts: If a census tract intersects with multiple geomarkets, it will appear once for each geomarket it intersects with, each time with the respective geomarket's eps code.
    #This results in some census tracts being duplicated in the joined dataframe, reflecting the fact that they span more than one geomarket.    

# transform crs to one that is good for mapping contiguous US
  # what chat gpt says about NAD83 / Conus Albers
  #NAD83 / Conus Albers CRS (Coordinate Reference System):
  #CRS Definition: A CRS is a coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities on a map. It defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth.
  #NAD83: North American Datum 1983, a geodetic datum providing a frame of reference for measuring locations on the Earth's surface in North America.
  #Conus Albers: A conic projection that is particularly well-suited for maps of the contiguous United States.
  # Why NAD83 / Conus Albers is a Good Choice for Mapping Metropolitan Areas:
  # Minimal Distortion: The Albers Equal Area Conic projection minimizes distortion in area, making it suitable for statistical and analytical purposes, especially for larger regions.
  # Uniform Coverage: It provides a consistent projection for the entire contiguous US, ensuring that all metropolitan areas are displayed with the same spatial reference.
  # Balance of Accuracy: The projection is designed to maintain a balance between shape and area accuracy, which is important for visualizing and analyzing spatial data across different regions.      

# Reproject sf object to NAD83 / Conus Albers
