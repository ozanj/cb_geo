# Introduction

### Introduction {.hide}

Historically, College Board offered two recruiting products to colleges

- Student Search Service (est. 1972): purchase contact information of prospects that meet "search filter" criteria
- Enrollment Planning Service (est. 1984): software-as-service, says which "Geomarkets" to target and which high schools to visit

College Board "Geomarkets" are an input in both products

- Geomarkets carve states and metro areas into smaller geographic regions meant to define local recruiting markets [@RN4982]

Concerns: Geomarket borders correlated with race/class; likely to be used in ways that undermine equality of opportunity

1. What is SES, racial variation between, within Geomarkets? Over time?
1. What is SES and racial composition of included vs. excluded prospects when student list purchases filter on particular Geomarkets?

<!-- Research interest: how quantification reproduces social stratification -->

# Background

### Background{.hide}
#### Geomarkets and Market Segment Model created by @RN4982

<p class="quote">Geomarkets</p>
<p style="display:none;">Boundaries [often] match formal political and educational divisions, reflecting natural channels of communication. Each major metro area is composed of several markets, usually corresponding to the inner city, a first ring of suburbs, and an outer ring of suburbs [@RN4982, p. 4].</p>

- Meant to reproduce the recruiting territories of admissions officers
- @RN4982 create 143 Geomarkets in three regions
- Enrollment Planning Service (EPS) uses 304 Geomarkets

**Market Segment Model**, based on student SAT score-sending behavior [SIMPLIFY]

- Each student-to-college score assigned to one of four categories:
  - Local (in Geomarket); in-state (diff Geomarket); regional; national
- Students sorted into 4 market segments: local, in-state, regional, national
  - "Local" students submit most SAT scores to local institutions
- *Market Segment Profile* (produced by Geomarket): 
  - How many students in each market segment
- *Institutional Profile*  (produced by Geomarket): 
  - How many students by market segement send scores to college *i*


# Theory

### Scholarship on quantification {.hide}
#### Discussion of correlation by @RN4975[chapter 1]

**Correlation**, extent to which variables move together

- Predictive analytics in two steps: 
    1. Measure correlations in previous cases (training data)
    1. Apply training data correlations to predict future cases
- But correlations from training data are point-in-time snapshot
  - Observed correlations caused by enduring structural inequality
  - "Predicting the future on the basis of the past threatens to reify and reproduce existing inequalities" [@RN4794, p. 224]

<p class="quote">@RN4982[chapter 3]</p>
<p style="display:none;">Our research has simply demonstrated what everyone has always known: communities with high levels of family income and parental education are also communities in which students have higher than average SATs and more far-reaching aspirations” [@RN4982, p. 42].</p>

- Which variables correlated with student market segment (training data)?
  - Parental education, family income, SAT score, educational aspirations
  - Conclusion: demand for higher education is a function of social origin
- Recommendation: selective colleges target high-SES Geomarkets


### Scholarship on quantification {.hide}
#### Discussion of homophily by @RN4975[chapter 2]

**Homophily**, birds of a feather flock together

- Network science assumes homophily result of voluntary action by actors
- But homophily programmed into algorithms that create connections
- Homophily in market research/geodemography
  - Based on snapshot of existing social stratification, match vertically categorized consumers to vertically categorized producers
  - Amplifies the effect of initial stratificaiton on subsequent stratification

<p class="quote">@RN4982[chapter 4]</p>
<p style="display:none;">The layering of collegiate competition is primarily a socioeconomic layering. The hierarchical structure of collegiate competition reflects the stratified social and economic dimensions of communities from which colleges draw their students. Competition among colleges, as admissions officers have told us for so long, is a matter of keeping company with one’s peers [@RN4982, p. 72].</p>

- Conducted a social network analysis (training data):
  - 2-mode network: students (1) tie to colleges (2) by sending scores
  - Colleges *i* and *j* compete if many students send scores to both
  - Conclusion: Like colleges compete for like (social origin) students

<p class="quote">Recommendation: target Geomarkets, HS targeted by peer colleges</p>
<p style="display:none;">On occasion, senior spokespersons for the profession worry that students outside the main market areas remain forgotten and hence, unchallenged. Inevitably, the increasing competition for students, the expense of travel and mailings, and internal political constraints compel institutions to concentrate their efforts where they will do the most good. The result is a natural reinforcing of the basic socioeconomic patterns that gave shape in the first place to the structure of college choice [@RN4982, p. 44].</p>


### Research questions and expectations{.hide}

**Research goals**

- Examine extent of social inequaltiy between Geomarkets (RQ1)
- Show how application of Geomarkets produces inequality (RQ2)

**Research questions**

1. SES and racial variation between, within Geomarkets? Change over time?

    - Geomarkets/Market Segment Model based on social stratification
    - US Racial segregation, correlation between class and race

1. SES and racial composition of included vs. excluded prospects, if "student list" purchases filter on particular Geomarkets?

    - Excluding Geomarkets that are poor and non-White associated with:
      - Disproportionate exclusion of first-generation students
      - Disproportionate exclusion of non-white students
      - Disproportionate exclusion of first-generation, non-white students
  
# Methods

### Methods{.hide}
#### Data

**RQ1: SES and racial variation over time between, within Geomarkets**

- Census tract-level data
  - 1980, 2000 Census; 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS)
  - Variables: race/Hispanic origin; median income, % poverty, % BA+
- Geomarket shapefiles obtained from 2012 blog post
  - Each zip code assigned to one Geomarket
  - Partial spatial assigns each Census tract to one or more Geomarkets

**RQ2: SES and racial composition of student list purchases**

- 414 student lists -- associated with 2.5 million prospects -- purchaseds by 14 public universities from 2016-2020
  - Each prospect has a home zip code and a HS zip code (point geoms)
- Analyze purchases that include all Geomarkets in a metro area
  - Show who would be excluded had search criteria exluded a Geomarket

### Methods{.hide}
#### Research design: quantitative case study

Cases are metro areas associated with multiple Geomarkets (n = 17)

<div style="margin-top: 0.8em;"></div>

Case selection

- Initial case selection based on availability of student list purchases (RQ2)
  - Prefer purchases that filter on test score, HS class, GPA, but not on student preferences (e.g., college size)
    - Ideal: purchases differ on test score range, but same on other filters
  - For some metros, don't have purchases that include all Geomarkets
- Final set of cases for manuscript main text (3 metro areas)
  - TBD; unsure about criteria
  - Conducted analyses for larger sample of metros

Analyses (RQ1 and RQ2)

- Descriptive statistics for between Geomarket variation
- Interactive maps for within Geomarket variation

# Discussion

### Discussion{.hide}
#### Summary of results

**RQ1: SES and racial variation over time between, within Geomarkets**

- Substantial inequality between and within Geomarkets
- In 1980, Black people are usually concentrated in poorest Geomarket
  - In some metros, this pattern persists (e.g., Cleveland)
  - In some metros, these Geomarkets experience gentrification

**RQ2: SES and racial composition of student list purchases**

- Poor, non-white Geomarkets produce disproportionate share of Black, Hispanic students, (and often Asian)
- Poor, non-white Geomarkets produce disproportionate share of first-generation students
- Purchased student profiles by race X parental education
  - Asian students from low-income Geomarkets tend to be first-gen compared to Asain students from affluent Geomarkets
  - Same result for Hispanic students

### Discussion{.hide}
#### Contribution to scholarship

Scholarship on quantification (in education)

- Scholarship has not examined "b2b" quantification that classifies consumers for the sake of producers
- @RN5005 show effect of quantification, but not mechanisms of *how* quantification produces inequality

Scholarship on postsecondary "organizational field"

- Scholarship focuses on schools and policies as "sorting machines" [@RN4873]
  - But EPS, Student Search Service products structure college access
  - College access structured by third-party vendors and products that amplify structural inequalities observed on demand-side
- Org field is "totality of relevant actors" [@RN527, p. 148]
  - The organizational field should be focus regulation
  - Sociology should identify high-leverage actors/products in org field
