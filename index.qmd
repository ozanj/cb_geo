# Introduction

### Introduction {.hide}

Two recruiting products sold by College Board

- Student Search Service (est. 1972): purchase contact information of prospects that meet "search filter" criteria [@RN5012]
- Enrollment Planning Service (EPS, est. 1984): software recommends which "Geomarkets" to target and which high schools to visit

College Board "Geomarkets" are an input in both products

- Geomarkets carve states and metro areas into smaller geographic regions meant to define local recruiting markets [@RN4982]

Concerns: Geomarket borders correlated with race/class; likely to be used in ways that undermine equality of opportunity

1. What is SES, racial variation between, within Geomarkets? Over time?
1. What is SES and racial composition of included vs. excluded prospects when student list purchases filter on particular Geomarkets?

<!-- Research interest: how quantification reproduces social stratification -->

# Background and Theory

### Background{.hide}
#### Geomarkets and Market Segment Model created by @RN4982

<p class="quote">Geomarkets</p>
<p style="display:none;">Boundaries [often] match formal political and educational divisions, reflecting natural channels of communication. **Each major metro area is composed of several markets, usually corresponding to the inner city, a first ring of suburbs, and an outer ring of suburbs.** In more sparsely populated areas, communities are sometimes combined in order to make the analysis meaningful. [@RN4982, p. 4].</p>

- Meant to reproduce the recruiting territories of admissions officers
- @RN4982 has 143 Geomarkets in 3 regions; EPS has 304

**Market Segment Model**

- Predicts how demand for a college varies by Geomarket, based on characteristics of households in Geomarket
- Categorize students into 4 market segments -- local, in-state, regional, national -- based on SAT score-sending behavior
  - local: send most scores to colleges within Geomarket
  - regional: send most scores out-of-state but in-region (e.g., Midwest)
- "Good" colleges should look for regional and national students
  - Like @RN2247, except College Board creates product from it
  - @RN4982 create outputs that become EPS software

### Scholarship on Quantification {.hide}
#### Discussions of correlation and homophily by @RN4975[chapter 1]

<p class="quote">**Correlation**: extent to which variables move together</p>
<p style="display:none;">Our research has simply demonstrated what everyone has always known: communities with high levels of family income and parental education are also communities in which students have higher than average SATs and more far-reaching aspirations” [@RN4982, p. 42].</p>

- Correlations observed in training data caused by structural inequality
  - "Predicting the future on the basis of the past threatens to reify and reproduce existing inequalities" [@RN4794, p. 224]
- @RN4982 find 4 predictors of student market segment
  - Parental education, family income, SAT score, educational aspirations
  - Recommend selective colleges target high-SES Geomarkets


<p class="quote">**Homophily**: birds of a feather flock together</p>
<p style="display:none;">The layering of collegiate competition is primarily a socioeconomic layering. The hierarchical structure of collegiate competition reflects the stratified social and economic dimensions of communities from which colleges draw their students. Competition among colleges, as admissions officers have told us for so long, is a matter of keeping company with one’s peers [@RN4982, p. 72].</p>


- Homophily not the result of voluntary action; homophily programmed into algorithms that create connections
  - Match vertically ranked consumers to vertically ranked producers
- @RN4982: like colleges compete for like students (SES)
<p class="quote" style="font-size: 0.85em;">Recommend colleges target Geomarkets, schools targeted by peer colleges</p>
<p style="display:none;">On occasion, senior spokespersons for the profession worry that students outside the main [Geo]market areas remain forgotten and hence, unchallenged. Inevitably, the increasing competition for students, the expense of travel and mailings, and internal political constraints compel institutions to concentrate their efforts where they will do the most good. The result is a natural reinforcing of the basic socioeconomic patterns that gave shape in the first place to the structure of college choice [@RN4982, p. 44].</p>

### Scholarship on quantification {.hide}
#### Discussion of correlation by @RN4975[chapter 1]

**Correlation**, extent to which variables move together

- Predictive analytics in two steps: 
    1. Measure correlations in previous cases (training data)
    1. Apply training data correlations to predict future cases
- But correlations from training data are point-in-time snapshot
  - Observed correlations caused by enduring structural inequality
  - "Predicting the future on the basis of the past threatens to reify and reproduce existing inequalities" [@RN4794, p. 224]

<p class="quote">@RN4982[chapter 3]</p>
<p style="display:none;">Our research has simply demonstrated what everyone has always known: communities with high levels of family income and parental education are also communities in which students have higher than average SATs and more far-reaching aspirations” [@RN4982, p. 42].</p>

- Which variables correlated with student market segment (training data)?
  - Parental education, family income, SAT score, educational aspirations
  - Conclusion: demand for higher education is a function of social origin
- Recommendation: selective colleges target high-SES Geomarkets


### Scholarship on quantification {.hide}
#### Discussion of homophily by @RN4975[chapter 2]

**Homophily**, birds of a feather flock together

- Network science assumes homophily result of voluntary action by actors
- But homophily programmed into algorithms that create connections
- Homophily in market research/geodemography
  - Based on snapshot of existing social stratification, match vertically categorized consumers to vertically categorized producers
  - Amplifies the effect of initial stratificaiton on subsequent stratification

<p class="quote">@RN4982[chapter 4]</p>
<p style="display:none;">The layering of collegiate competition is primarily a socioeconomic layering. The hierarchical structure of collegiate competition reflects the stratified social and economic dimensions of communities from which colleges draw their students. Competition among colleges, as admissions officers have told us for so long, is a matter of keeping company with one’s peers [@RN4982, p. 72].</p>

- Conducted a social network analysis (training data):
  - 2-mode network: students (1) tie to colleges (2) by sending scores
  - Colleges *i* and *j* compete if many students send scores to both
  - Conclusion: Like colleges compete for like (social origin) students

<p class="quote">Recommendation: target Geomarkets, HS targeted by peer colleges</p>
<p style="display:none;">On occasion, senior spokespersons for the profession worry that students outside the main market areas remain forgotten and hence, unchallenged. Inevitably, the increasing competition for students, the expense of travel and mailings, and internal political constraints compel institutions to concentrate their efforts where they will do the most good. The result is a natural reinforcing of the basic socioeconomic patterns that gave shape in the first place to the structure of college choice [@RN4982, p. 44].</p>

### Research questions{.hide}

<br>

**Research interests**

- How unequal are these Geomarkets?
- Who is included/excluded if we purchase student lists and filter on Geomarkets as recommended by @RN4982

<br>

**Research questions**

1. What is the socioeconomic and racial variation between and within Geomarkets? How does this change over time?
1. What is the socioeconomic and and racial composition of included vs. excluded prospects, if "student list" purchases filter on particular Geomarkets?


# Methods

### Methods{.hide}
#### Data

**RQ1: SES and racial variation over time between, within Geomarkets**

- Census tract-level data
  - 1980, 2000 Census, 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS)
- Geomarket shapefiles obtained from a 2012 blog post
  - Each zip code assigned to one Geomarket
- Partial spatial assigns each Census tract to one or more Geomarkets

**RQ2: SES and racial composition of student list purchases**

- Student lists purchased by 14 public universities from 2016-2020
  - 414 student lists associated with 2.5 million prospects
    - Data: search filter criteria; and de-identified student-level data
    - Each prospect has a home and a HS zip code (point geoms)
- Analyze purchases that include all Geomarkets in a metro area
  - Show who included/excluded if we filter on particular Geomarkets

### Methods{.hide}
#### Research design is a quantitative case study



<div style="margin-top: 0.8em;"></div>

Cases 

- Cases are metro areas associated with multiple Geomarkets (n ~ 17)
- Initial case selection based on availability of student list purchases (RQ2)
  - Prefer purchases that filter on test score, HS class, GPA, but not on student preferences (e.g., college size)
  - Ideal: purchases differ on test score range, but same on other filters
  - For some metros, don't have purchases that include all Geomarkets
- Final set of cases for manuscript main text (3 metro areas)
  - TBD; unsure about criteria
  - Conducted analyses for larger sample of metros

Analyses (RQ1 and RQ2)

- Descriptive statistics for between Geomarket variation
- Interactive maps for within Geomarket variation

# Discussion

### Discussion{.hide}
#### Summary of results

**RQ1: SES and racial variation over time between, within Geomarkets**

- Geomarkets highly correllated with race and class in many metros
- In 1980, Black people are usually concentrated in poorest Geomarket
  - In some metros, this pattern persists (e.g., Cleveland)

**RQ2: SES and racial composition of student list purchases**

- Poor, non-white Geomarkets produce disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic students
- Poor, non-white Geomarkets produce disproportionate share of first-generation students
- Intersection of race and parental education
  - Compared to students from affluent Geomarkets, Asian and Hispanic students from low-income Geomarkets tend to be first-gen
  - Targeting non-white students in affluent Geomarkets yields mostly non-first-gen


### Discussion{.hide}
#### Contribution to scholarship

Scholarship on quantification (in education)

- Hasn't examined quantification that classifies consumers for producers
  - Structural inequality $\rightarrow$ unequal student demand for college
  - Third-party products take snapshot student demand $\rightarrow$ encourage supply-side to amplify structural inequalities observed on demand-side
- @RN5005 show effect of quantification, but not mechanisms of *how* quantification produces inequality

Scholarship on postsecondary "organizational field"

- Soc-of-ed focuses on schools (and policies) as "sorting machines"
  - But third-party vendors have structured college access for decades
- Org field is "totality of relevant actors" [@RN527, p. 148]
  - Organizational field should be focus of regulation
  - Sociology should identify high-leverage actors/products in org field
