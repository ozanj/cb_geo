**ABSTRACT**

*The Structure of College Choice* [@RN4982] created "Geomarkets" and the "Market Segment Model." Geomarkets carve states and metropolitan areas into smaller geographic units, meant to define local recruiting markets. The Market Segment Model predicts how student demand for a particular college varies by Geomarket, based on the socioeconomic characteristics of households. Geomarkets became an input for two College Board products that help colleges recruit students. First, the Enrollment Planning Service (EPS) software recommends specific Geomarkets and high schools from which colleges should recruit. Second, the Student Search Service sells the contact information of prospective students -- referred to as "student lists" -- and colleges can filter by Geomarket to determine which prospect profiles they purchase. We draw from scholarship on quantification, particularly the discussions of correlation and homophily by @RN4975, to conceptualize how recruiting products incorporate Geomarkets. We address two research questions: What is the socioeconomic and racial variation between Geomarkets and how does this variation change over time? How does the socioeconomic and racial composition of included versus excluded prospects vary when student list purchases filter on particular Geomarkets? We answer RQ1 by analyzing Census data from 1980, 2000, and 2020. We answer RQ2 using data on student lists purchased by public universities, which we collected by issuing public records requests. We utilize a quantitative case study design. Metropolitan areas are cases. Analyses consist of descriptive statistics and interactive maps.

# Data and Methods

## Data and Variables

**RQ1**. RQ1 primarily utilizes Census Data while RQ2 primarily utilizes data about student list purchases. Research question 1 is about socioeconomic and racial variation between Geomarkets in metropolitan areas and how such variation changes over time. To answer this question, we use census tract data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Utilizing a small geographic area is important for implementing a spatial merge between Census data and Geomarket shape files (described below). Census tract is the smallest geographic area for which measures of both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic characteristics are available. Census tracts are statistical subdivisions of a county designed to capture relatively homogeneous demographic communities that are generally considered to be more accurate for population analyses than zip codes, which are spatial boundaries drawn to demarcate route efficiency for postal services \[[CITE](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2014/07/understanding-geographic-relationships-counties-places-tracts-and-more.html)\] .

We use data from the 1980 and the 2000 Decennial Census as well as 5-year estimates from the 2020 American Community Survey (ACS). For the 1980 Decennial Census, we draw from Summary Tape File 1 (STF1) for variables about race and Hispanic origin collected via "short form" questions answered by all households. We draw from Summary Tape File 3 (STF3) for variables about socioeconomic characteristics (income, education, and poverty) collected via the "long form" questionnaire completed by a sample of roughly 20% of all households. The 1980 Decennial Census data collection period closely matches the data collection period of SAT score-sending behavior that @RN4982 utilized to create Geomarkets and the Market Segment Model. For the 2000 Decennial Census, we similarly use the Summary File 1A (SF1A) for census-tract measures of race and Hispanic origin and the Summary File 3A (SF3A) for census-tract measures of income, education, and poverty.[^1] Beginning in 2010, the Decennial Census no longer collected a "long form" questionnaire. These questions were replaced by ACS. Therefore, we also utilized the 2020 5-year ACS for both race and socioeconomic characteristics at the census tract level, which includes data collected from 2016-2020.[^2] This data collection period mirrors the period for our primary data collection about student list purchases used to analyze RQ2, as described below.

[^1]: Data for the 1980 and 2000 Decennial Census were retrieved from the IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System, created by @RN5028.

[^2]: Data for the 2020 5-year ACS were retreived from the [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) R package, created by @tidycensus_citation

Across these data sources, we created measures of race and ethnicity, specifically the number and proportion of the census-tract population in the following categories: White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Asian, non-Hispanic; Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; American Indian and Alaskan Native, non-Hispanic; and two or more races, non-Hispanic. Measures of Asian, American Indian and Alaskan Native, two or more races, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (all non-Hispanic) were not available for the 1980 Decennial Census. We also created socioeconomic measures that approximate the predictors of market segment identified by @RN4982. These variables are median household income, percent of households below the poverty line, and people age 25+ with a BA. All measures were created at the census tract-level and at the the Geomarket-level by aggregating tract-level data to Geomarkets.

We assigned each census tract to College Board Geomarkets by implementing a partial spatial merge. Spatial manipulations utilized functions from the *sf* R package. Data to create the shapefiles for the College Board Geomarkets were obtained from a 2012 R-bloggers post.[^3] Essentially, the data file had one observation per zip code and a column that assigned each zip code to one Geomarket. Using these zip code-level data, we utilized the `aggregate()` function to create shapefiles for each Geomarket.

[^3]: The author of the post reported that he found the zip codes associated with Geomarkets from a Google search.

Next, we utilized the `st_intersection()` function to assign each census tract to a Geomarket, based on the intersection of their associated spatial shapefiles. We split census-tract shapefiles that intersected multiple Geomarkets (i.e., tracts whose boundaries spanned two or more Geomarkets) into smaller shapefiles, each entirely contained within a single Geomarket. We replaced each variable in these shapefiles with its original value scaled by the share of the tract’s land area that lay within the Geomarket. For a particular census tract, imagine that 60% of its land area was contained in Geomarket A, 40% of its land area was contained in Geomarket B, and the census tract reports 100 people who identify as Asian, non-Hispanic. The partial spatial merge splits this census tract into two observations. The observation assigned to Geomarket A reports $.60*100 = 60$ Asian, non-Hispanic people and the observation assigned to Geomarket B reports $.40*100 = 40$ Asian, non-Hispanic people.

**RQ2**. Our second research question asks, how does the racial and socioeconomic composition of included versus excluded prospects vary when student list purchases filter on Geomarkets? We answer this question using actual student lists purchased by public universities. In February 2020, we began issuing public records requests to public universities about student lists purchased from 2016 through 2020. We narrowed the scope of our request to student lists purchased from College Board, ACT, and the National Research Center for College and University Admissions (NRCCUA), the three largest student list vendors at the time. For each student list purchased from 2016 through 2020, we requested two related pieces of data: (1) the order summary, which specifies search criteria for the student list purchase; and (2) the de-identified prospect-level list produced from these search criteria.

The data collection sample for this project was all public universities in California, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. We chose these states because they were priorities for the two foundations that funded the data collection. Utilizing public records requests to obtain quantitative data is a painstaking process, made more difficult by the onset of the Covid Pandemic. Initially, the majority of universities ignored or denied our request. We established a client relationship with a civil rights legal organization and leveraged this relationship to obtain pro bono representation from four law firms. Firm representation substantially increased the success of data collection. We also collected data from Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, because we were able to obtain pro-bono legal representation for these two universities. However, we were unable to obtain legal representation for Texas because firms interested in representing us had conflicts of interest in Texas.

Firm representation substantially increased the success of data collection. Nevertheless, data collection remained difficult. Some universities provided records that were not usable for quantitative analyses (e.g., summary statistics across multiple orders; or data did not contain important fields). Some universities did not provide records based on legitimate legal grounds (e.g., data not in university possession; not required to create records that do not currently exist). We learned that many universities outsourced student list purchases to third-party consulting firms, particularly [EAB](https://eab.com/). Unfortunately, we were rarely able to obtain usable data from these universities. Several universities denied requests based on questionable legal rationale, but we lacked the resources to litigate.

The primary data source for our second research question is student lists purchased from College Board for which we received both (a) the order summary data and (b) the de-identified prospect-level student list data. This sample includes a total of 414 orders associated with 2,549,085 prospects made by 14 \[KS CHECK THIS\] public universities located in California, Illinois, Texas, and Arizona. Although these lists were purchased by individual universities, the set of prospects included in each list is a function of the search criteria specified for that student list purchase. The resulting student lists could hypothetically extend to any university placing student lists orders based on the same filter criteria. In other words, any observed patterns in the findings below would remain constant for any university selecting the same filters.[^4] Therefore, we utilize these data not to analyze the behavior of individual universities, but to identify which prospective students are included when a particular set of search criteria are selected.

[^4]: ADD CAVEAT THAT PURCHASES EXCLUDE PROSPECT PROFILES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED

In particular, we answer the second research question by analyzing particular student list purchases that did *not* utilize the Geomarket search filter and purchased prospects from all Geomarkets in a particular metropolitan area.[^5] For each prospect, we know their home zip code and, therefore, which Geomarket they belong to. Our analyses then show which students would have been included or excluded from the student list purchase had the purchase filtered on particular Geomarkets.

[^5]: For analyses of Dallas, Detroit, Long Island, Northern New Jersey, and Philadelphia, we utilize data from student list purchases that did filter on Geomarkets but included all Geomarkets in the region.

The variables of interest are Geomarket and prospect-level characteristics, which are derived from the pretest questionnaire administered to College Board test-takers that are included in the de-identified student lists we received (e.g., HS code, HS GPA range, intended major). College Board asks students separate questions about ethnicity (Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic, ethnicity non-response) and race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, race non-response), allowing students to check as many boxes as they want (College Board, 2016) \[CITE\]. From these responses, a College Board "derived aggregate race/ethnicity" was re-created based on the U.S. Department of Education reporting guidelines that includes the following categories: no response; American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian; Black; Hispanic/Latino; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; White; other; two or more races, non-Hispanic (College Board, 2016) \[CITE\].[^6] Information about student socioeconomic status is limited. However, we create a measure of whether the prospect is first-generation college student based on their parents' level of education that was self-reported on the College Board questionnaire \[KS double check this\].

[^6]: Any student who selects a Hispanic ethnicity category is defined as Hispanic/Latino, regardless of the race categories they select. Additionally, non-Hispanic students who check “American Indian or Alaska Native” and another race group are defined as “two or more races, non-Hispanic.”

## Methods

**Research design**. We utilize a multiple, quantitative case study design. Metropolitan areas are cases. Case studies deepen understanding of phenomena by comparing and contrasting across different settings \[CITE YIN 2001\]. Our research questions explore the socioeconomic and racial variation between Geomarkets, how such variation changes over time, and how Geomarket landscapes shape the composition of included versus excluded prospects. Our goal is not to generalize Geomarket variation nationally, but rather to explore how differences across Geomarket landscapes shape prospect pools based on the geographical model of metropolitan areas and their demographic characteristics \[MAKE THIS MORE ABOUT EXPLORING THE MODEL. THIS SENTENCE SOUNDS FANCY BUT DOESN'T REALLY SAY ANYTHING\]. Such aims align with the purpose of case studies, which drive the exploration of research questions focused on the "how" and "why" of phenomenon in rich and nuanced contexts. We, therefore, select a small number of metropolitan areas in order to provide sufficient analytic depth while situating each case within its specific historic and contemporary sociodemographic characteristics \[TIE IN THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK HERE A BIT MORE\]. Online Appendix XXX presents results for a larger number of metropolitan areas.

Case selection was informed by purposeful sampling to identify "information-rich" cases (Patton, 2002; Yin, 2009)[CITE] that can provide knowledge about variation across Geomarkets and over time. We considered metropolitan areas as information rich cases across three broad dimensions: 1) urban model structures, 2) geographical variation, 3) variation across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics, and 4) availability of student list orders and de-identified list data. Based on @RN4982, we identified classic urban model structures that reflected "major metropolitan area[s] \ldots composed of several markets, usually corresponding to the inner city, a first ring of suburbs, and an outer ring of suburbs" (p. 11-12), such as Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Miami, and Philadelphia. To compare and contrast with classic urban model structures, we also identified alternative urban models such as bimodal or metroplex models that contain two centralized cores surrounded by the more classing suburban ring (e.g., Dallas-Fort Worth and San Francisco) and multi-nuclei models where urban growth develops around multiple, sometimes uncentralized and independent, metropolitan areas (e.g., Los Angeles and New York City). The third consideration addresses geographical variations in demographic populations by intentionally selecting metropolitan cases across different U.S. regions (West, Midwest, Northeast, South) to ensure resident and prospect pools mirror broader populations. Related to all previous selection dimensions, we are also interested in variation of racial and socioeconomic populations between Geomarkets within a metropolitan areas (RQ1) and how such variation shapes which prospective students are targeted by student list purchases (RQ2). We therefore considered whether or not metropolitan areas provided sufficient and varied racial and socioeconomic diversity for our research purposes.

Lastly, choice of metropolitan cases was informed by student list data availability. Although Census data are available for all metropolitan areas nationally (RQ1), we do not have good candidate student list data for all metropolitan areas (RQ2). In order to show which prospective students would have been included or excluded from the student list purchase had the purchase filtered on particular Geomarkets, the student list purchases we analyze must include all Geomarkets in a metropolitan area. This lead us to select on orders that filtered for an entire state (e.g., State filter is set to Pennsylvania), an entire metropolitan area without a Geomarket filter (CBSA filter is set to the Philadelphia metropolitan area), or an entire metropolitan area with a Geomarket filter inclusive of all Geomarkets (CBSA filter is set to the Philadelphia metropolitan area and Geomarket filter is set to all five Geomarkets in the Philadelphia area). Although we would like to analyze the D.C./Maryland/Virginia (DMV) area, the student list purchases we collected exclude "MD 5 -- Prince Georges Metropolitan" and "MD 7 -- Baltimore (Urban), which are substantially poorer and more Black than other Geomarkets in the DMV. Similarly, student list purchases targeting Cleveland exclude "OH 4 -- City of Cleveland (East)."

In order to isolate the impact of Geomarkets on the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of prospect pools, we did not consider purchases that utilized student preference (e.g., campus size, intended major), low-income household, or first-generation status filters. Because nearly all orders we collected (Author, BLINDED) filter on some academic criteria, we only considered orders that included assessment threshold filters (e.g., PSAT, SAT) across a wide score range to explore whether and to what extent Geomarket contributions to prospect pools are consistent across all score ranges.

Our case selection process resulted in three metropolitan cases: Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles.

**Analyses**. Analyses are simultaneously descriptive and spatial. We answer RQ1 by producing Geomarket-level tables and graphs that show how the Geomarkets in a selected metropolitan area vary on racial and socioeconomic characteristics and how they vary over time. We also produce interactive maps at the census tract-level to show more granular variation within and between Geomarkets.

We answer RQ2 by analyzing student list purchases that encompassed all Geomarkets in a selected metropolitan areas. Descriptive tables and graphs describe the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of prospects that would have been included/excluded had the purchase filtered on particular Geomarkets. We also create interactive maps of prospect pools by Geomarket contributions to provide a more granular visualization of analyses.

Our conceptual framework suggests that racial and socioeconomic inequality is Geomarket regions is associated with the number of geomarkets in the metropolitan area. and is associated with the patterns of racial segregation in the metropolitan area. comment more on this.

Below, we use simulations and actual student list purchases that filtered on geomarkets. In purchases that filtered on test-score and/or GPA thresholds, we can simluate who would be included and excluded had certain Geomarkets were been selected. In purchases that filter on geomarkets, we can get an initial sense of who is included in geomarkets targeted by regional state colleges versus research universities.

# Findings

## Chicago

### Shifting Demographics, Persistent Segregation in Geomarket Landscape

@fig-chicago-maps presents the seven Geomarkets in the Chicago metropolitan area by total population across the three census periods. The maps in the figure show how Chicago Geomarkets reflect the classic urban geographical structure of an inner-city core surrounded by a ring of suburbs as described by @RN4982 [p. 12]. Based on the color gradient scale representing total population density, @fig-chicago-maps indicates northern suburb Geomarkets in the metropolitan area - Chain of Lakes, Northwest Suburbs, Northshore, Evanston and Skokie - experienced relatively little population growth from 1980 through 2020. In contrast, the most significant population increases occured in the Western Suburbs (1.2 Million to 1.6 Million) and the South and Southwest Suburbs (less than 1 Million to 1.3 Million) Geomarkets. The City of Chicago Geomarket, forming the metropolitan area's central core, was the only locality to experience a population decline, from 3.1 Million in 1980 to 2.8 Million in 2020, despite remaining the most densely populated Geomarket.

These modest population shifts lead to substantial change in the racial/ethnic composition within and across Geomarkets over time. @fig-chicago-rq1-race illustrates the racial and ethnic composition of each Geomarket across the three census periods. In 1980, nearly all Geomarkets were predominantly White, with proportions ranging from 83% in the South and Southwest Suburbs to approximately 93% in North Shore. In contrast, the City of Chicago had a substantially more diverse population, with White residents comprising only 46% of its total population. By 2020, several Geomarkets that were previously predominantly White shifted to a more heterogeneous racial/ethnic distribution, including Chain of Lakes (59% White, 8% Black, 24% Hispanic; 7% Asian Pacific Islander), Northwest Suburbs (62% White, 3% Black, 18% Hispanic; 15% Asian Pacific Islander), Evanston and Skokie (64% White, 7% Black, 10% Hispanic; 16% Asian Pacific Islander), Western Suburbs (56% White, 9% Black, 23% Hispanic; 9% Asian Pacific Islander), and South and Southwest Suburbs (53% White, 24% Black, 18% Hispanic; 3% Asian Pacific Islander). For many Geomarkets, this balance in racial/ethnic composition was the result of large increases in the Latinx population from 1980 to 2020, which ranged from a 7 percentage point increase for the Evanston and Skokie Geomarket to a 19 percentage point increase for Western Suburbs. Some Geomarkets also experienced a substantial increase in Black populations (South and Southwest Suburbs) and in Asian populations (Northwest Suburbs and Evanston and Skokie). @fig-chicago-rq1-race also indicates that, although the North Shore and City of Chicago Geomarkets underwent some changes in racial and ethnic composition, their overall demographic patterns remained relatively the same across the three census periods. <!-- For instance, North Shore experienced some increases in Hispanic (2% in 1980 to 8% in 2020), Asian Pacific Islander (7% in 2000 to 10% in 2020), and Black (2% in 1980 to 3% in 2020) populations yet remained a predominantly White Geomarket (74% in 2020). City of Chicago also experienced relatively modest declines in its Black population (37% in 1980 to 33% in 2020), alongside increases in its Hispanic (15% in 1980 to 26% in 2020) and Asian Pacific Islander populations (4% in 2000 to 6% in 2020), further substantiating the Geomarket as the most racially/ethnic diverse in the metropolitan area. -->

We also explore socioeconomic demographics - median income, percent living below poverty, and educational attainment - within and across Geomarkets over time in @fig-chicago-rq1-ses. Overall, median income both within and across Geomarkets in the Chicago metropolitan area remained relatively stable across the three census periods. For instance, in 1980, median household income across the Chicago metropolitan area ranged from a high of \$158,000 in the North Shore Geomarket to a low of \$66,000 in the City of Chicago Geomarket. However, median incomes in all other Geomarkets were closer to the upper thresholds of affluence, such as \$120,000 in the Northwest Suburbs, \$119,000 in Evanston and Skokie, \$108,000 in Chain of Lakes, \$105,000 in the Western Suburbs, and \$99,000 in the South and Southwest Suburbs. While overall income patterns across Geomarkets remained consistent through 2020, a median income increase for the City of Chicago Geomarket (\$79,000) and decrease in the South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarket (\$93,000) narrowed the income gap between the lowest and second-lowest Geomarkets to just \$14,000.

@fig-chicago-rq1-ses also shows that from 1980 to 2020, the percentage of residents living in poverty declined in the City of Chicago Geomarket while it increased in all other Geomarkets, resulting in a narrowing of poverty gaps across the Chicago metropolitan area. Similar patterns are evident in educational attainment across Geomarkets. In 1980, the City of Chicago had the lowest percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher (13%). However, by 2020, the Geomarket experienced the largest percentage point increase in college degree attainment, reaching 38%. In comparison, all other Geomarkets experienced smaller gains in the share of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher over the same period. These trends contributed to a narrowing of the educational attainment gap across Geomarkets from 1980 to 2020.

Demographic shifts overtime have transformed the Chicago metropolitan area's Geomarket landscape from largely a binary structure into a more tiered dynamic shaped by substantial racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequality between Geomarkets. The original Geomarket boundaries delineated significant racial and income segregation in the 1980s. This included Black, Hispanic, and Asian residents primarily in the City of Chicago Geomarket and White residents in Geomarkets forming the suburban ring of the metropolitan area. Income, poverty, and educational attainment also created a static socioeconomic divide in 1980, with southern Geormarkets (City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs) characterized by lower affluence and educational attainment compared to the higher socioeconomic standing of the northwestern suburbs. However, declining White populations, Hispanic and Asian population growth, and Black out-migration, as well as narrowing of education and poverty gaps within some Geomarkets, have contributed to a more stratified Geomarket dynamic in the metropolitan area with significant disparities remaining between Geomarkets. The City of Chicago Geomarket remains the critical geographical hub across all Geomarkets for racial/ethnic diversity; however, other Geomarkets now also include substantive numbers of residents across racial/ethnic groups (such as South and Southwest Geomarket for Black residents, Chain of Lakes for Hispanic residents, and Northwest Suburbs for Asian residents). While some stark socioeconomic gaps within Geomarkets have narrowed since 1980, significant geographical income segregation remains between Geomarkets despite a more clearly defined middle-to-high socioeconomic Geomarket group (Chain of Lakes, Northwest Suburbs, Western Suburbs).

<!--# [I THINK SOME DETAIL CAN BE REDUCED HERE; ALSO, I THINK YOU ARE BURYING THE LEDE THAT NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED: THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RACIAL AND SES INEQUALITY BETWEEN GEOMARKETS AND CHICAGO ESPECIALLY IS POOREST AND MOST NON-WHITE ————-  DALLAS IS POOREST AND MOST NON-WHITE; NOT CHI] -->

### Composition of Students Lists by Geomarket Contributions

To examine how the socioeconomic and racial composition of included versus excluded prospects varies when student list purchases filter on particular Geomarkets, we analyze six orders placed by a research university targeting prospects across the entire state of Illinois. The first two orders filter on the same SAT thresholds (ranging from 1020 to 1150), the same GPA thresholds (ranging from B- to A+), and filter on the high school graduating classes of 2020 and 2021 graduating classes, respectively. The remaining four orders used similar GPA and high school class filters but differed in SAT thresholds. Two orders targeted students with relatively middle-range scores (1160 to 1300) and two orders targeted those with relatively high scores (1310 to 1600). Because all six orders included an Illinois state filter, we can utilize prospects from the Chicago metropolitan area within the resulting student lists to examine Geomarket contributions by simulating the application of a Geomarket filter across low-, middle-, and high-range SAT threshold orders.

<!--# DISCUSSION OF THIS FIGURE SOMEWHAT BURIES THE LEAD THAT CHICAGO LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS IN TERMS OF RACIAL COMPOSITION OF PURCHASED PROFILES! -->

@fig-chicago-rq2-race presents the racial/ethnic composition of purchased student profiles within Geomarkets in the Chicago metropolitan area, notably revealing that the City of Chicago stands out distinctly from all other Geomarkets in terms of the substantial racial and ethnic diversity of its purchased profiles. At the lowest PSAT score thresholds (top panel, 1020-1150) the racial/ethnic distribution of prospects within Geomarkets most closely reflects the demographic makeup of the metropolitan area in 2020 (see @fig-chicago-rq1-race). For example, more than 8,000 of the 15,981 total prospects in this SAT range order were concentrated in the Western Suburbs (56% White, 8% Asian, 6% Black, 26% Hispanic, 4% Multiracial) and South and Southwest Suburbs (55% White, 3% Asian, 17% Black, 22% Hispanic, and 3% Multiracial), both of which yield majority White prospect pools comparable to the racial/ethnic makeup of their overall Geomarket populations. The North Shore (78% White, 8% Asian, 2% Black, 8% Hispanic) and the Northwest Suburbs (61% White, 11% Asian, 2% Black, 23% Hispanic) Geomarket pools exhibit the greatest proportions of White prospects. Unlike any other Geomarket, nearly nine of every 10 prospects from the City of Chicago Geomarket were Hispanic (50%), Black (30%), Asian (5%), or Multiracial (2%).

The City of Chicago Geomarket increasingly becomes the only Geomarket with substantial shares of Black, and Hispanic prospects as PSAT scores increase. All Geomarkets experience growth in the shares of White and Asian prospects, while Black and Hispanic prospect shares decline. For instance, the City of Chicago Geomarket pool is 18% Asian, 7% Black, 21% Hispanic, 5% Multiracial, making it the only Geomarket that is not predominantly White (49%). Prospect pools from all other Geomarkets in this high PSAT order are predominantly White and Asian, with Black and Hispanic shares ranging from 0.4% (North Shore) to 5% (South and Southwest Suburbs) of prospects and 6% (Northwest Suburbs) to 10% (South and Southwest Suburbs) of prospects, respectively. <!--# [LEDE -- BUT IN BOTH THE MEDIUM AND HIGH THRESHOULD, CHICAGO IS THE ONLY GEOMARKET WHERE A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF PROSPECTS ARE NOT WHITE OR ASIAN] -->

We also explore contributions across Geomarkets to overall prospect pools by race/ethnicity. For instance, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race shows the contributions of each Geomarket to the pool of prospects from the two orders targeting middle range SAT scores (1160-1300) by race/ethnicity. The top panel presents the full distribution of the 13,643 total prospects (whose race/ethnicity is known) included in these orders by Geomarkets: 11% reside in Chain of Lakes, 13% in Northwest Suburbs, 5% in North Shore, 5% in Evanston and Skokie, 17% in City of Chicago, 28% in Western Suburbs, and 20% in South and Southwest Suburbs. These overall distributions are compared to those in the lower panels of @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race, which illustrate the proportional representation of each race/ethnicity group across Geomarkets.

```{=html}
<!-- OLD RESULTS BASED ON LOW VERSUS HIGH SAT ORDERS
Nearly one half (n=7,728) of all prospects whose contact information was purchased in these lower SAT score orders identified as White. With the exception of the City of Chicago, @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-race shows all Geomarkets contributed to the pool of White prospects at rates nearly proportional to their overall contributions to all included prospects. The City of Chicago Geomarket, however, contributed only 5% of White prospects, despite accounting for 20% of all included prospects. Similar patterns are observed for Asian students, with proportional contributions by Geomarket largely consistent with thier overall distribution, exept for Evanston and Skokie (12% versus 4% for all prospects) contributing disproportionately larger shares and the South and Southwest Suburbs (10% versus 26% for all prospects) contributing smaller shares relative to their overall representation.

In contrast, these representational patterns are reversed for Black and Hispanic prospects in @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-race. Among the more than 2,000 Black students included in these orders, the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs contributed disproportionately higher shares, 48% and 34%, respectively, compared to their overall contributions of 20% and 26% of all included prospects, whereas all other Geomarkets contributed substantially smaller proportions of Black prospects. The City of Chicago Geomarket also contributed larger shares of the nearly 5,000 Hispanic students (35% versus 20% for all prospects), while all other Geomarkets contributed comprable or relatively smaller proportions of Hispanic prospects than their overall representation among all included prospects.

@fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race and @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-race similarly depict Geomarket contributions for pools of prospects resulting from orders targeting middle-range (1160-1300) and high-range (1310-1600) SAT scores. Both figures demonstrate how representational Geomarket patterns across race/ethnicity remain relatively consistent even as SAT scores increase. For instance, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race shows that the Chain of Lakes, North Shore, and Western Suburbs Geomarkets contributed similar proportions of White and Asian students, yet smaller proportions of Black and Hispanic students, relative to their overall representation among all included prospects. The Northwest Suburbs and Evanston and Skokie similarly contributed a disproportionately higher share of Asian prospects, but lower shares of Black and Hispanic students. Conversely, the South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarket contributed a substantially larger proportion of Black students, while the City of Chicago yielded larger proportions of both Black and Hispanic students- again, relative to their overall representation among all included prospects targeted at middle range SAT scores. Despite declines in the overall number of Black (n=240) and Hispanic (n=950) prospects included in orders filtering for high-ranges of SAT scores (1310-1600), @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-race shows overall Geomarket contribution patterns persist.

We also examine the contributions of each Geomarket to the pool of prospects based on first-generation college student status. Similar to race/ethnicity figures above, @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-ses presents the Geomarket distribution for the 16,060 total prospects (whose first-generations status is known) included in low-range SAT score orders (1020-1150). Among the 3,479 total prospects whose parents did not attend college, the City of Chicago stands out as the only Geomarket contributing a disproportionately larger share of first-generation college students - 34% in comparison to 20% for all included prospects in this SAT range. In contrast, all other Geomarkets contributed disproportionately smaller shares of first-generation college students relative to all included prospects, with such disparity ranging from a one-percentage-point difference (Chain of Lakes, Northwest Suburbs, North Shore) to a five-percentage-point difference (Western Suburbs). For prospects whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degrees, @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-ses indicates both City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarkets contribute a disproportionately larger share of first-generation students. These representational patterns are reversed among prospects that are not first-generation college students. The City of Chicago Geomarket contributed a substantially smaller share of not-first generation prospects (13%) relative to all prospects (20%) in this SAT range, whereas all other Geomarkets contributed either comparable (Northwest Suburbs, South and Southwest Suburbs) or disproportionately larger shares (Chain of Lakes, North Sore, Evanston and Skokie, Western Suburbs).

@fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses and @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-ses demonstrate Geomarket contribution patterns by first-generation college student status become increasingly pronounced in orders targeting middle-range (1160-1300) and high-range (1310-1600) SAT scores, respectively. At the middle SAT score range in @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses, the City of Chicago Geomarket contributes a substantially larger share of first-generation students whose parents did not attend college—38%, compared to 17% of all included prospects in this range, representing a 21-percentage-point disparity. This disproportionality increases to a 25-percentage-point difference at the highest SAT score thresholds in @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-ses, where the City of Chicago accounts for 40% of such first-generation students, despite representing only 15% of all included prospects in this score range.

Finally, we examine Geomarket contributions to prospect pools by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity in the Chicago metropolitan area. @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-combo presents the Geomarket distribution of the 15,183 total prospects (whose first-generation status and race/ethnicity is known) included in low-range SAT (120-1150) orders. For instance, among all White prospects (n=7,605) whose contact information was purchased in this SAT score range, approximately 11% were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 22% were first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree, and 67% were not first-generation college students. @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-combo shows the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarkets disproportionately contribute larger shares of White first-generation college students who parents did not attend college (22% and 15%, respectively) and whose parents attended some college but never completed degrees (29% and 28%, respectively). In contrast, Geomarkets such as Chain of Lakes (72%), North Shore (88%), Evanston and Skokie (73%) contribute a disproportionately larger share of White prospects who are not first-generation college students.

@fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-combo indicates these Geomarket patterns persist across other racial/ethnic categories. The City of Chicago Geomarket consistently contributed a disproportionately large share of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college across all racial/ethnic categories. However, the magnitude of this disproportionality varied- from a 3-percentage-point difference for Black prospects to a 21 percentage-point difference for Asian prospects. Among Hispanic students, contributions to the first-generation prospect pool were notably balanced across Geomarkets, with the exception of North Shore and Evanston and Skokie Geomarkets, which contributed substantially lower shares of first-generation Hispanic students. Although Asian and Black prospects who are not first-generation college students make up a relatively smaller portion of the overall pool, @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-combo suggests that such prospects are primarily contributed by the Chain of Lakes, North Shore, and Evanston and Skokie Geomarkets.

Geomarket contribution patterns to prospect pools by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity become more pronounced as SAT score thresholds increase. For instance, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo presents prospect pools disaggregated by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity within the middle-range SAT score (1160–1300) orders. The City of Chicago Geomarket still contributes a disproportionately larger share of first-generation college students for both those whose parents did not attend college and those whose parents attended some college but did not complete a degree across most racial and ethnic groups. However, the magnitude of this disproportionately for City of Chicago becomes even greater for Asian students, with a nearly 30-percentage-point difference collectively for all first-generation college students (35% no college and 22% some college) relative to their overall Geomarket representation (28%). Similar to patterns observed at lower SAT score thresholds, the Geomarket contributions to first-generation Hispanic college students remain relatively balanced. All Geomarkets, with the exception of North Shore (22%) and Evanston and Skokie (32%), contributed more than 50% first-generation Hispanic college students across both parental education categories to the overall prospect pool.

@fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-combo shows the magnitude of Geomarket contribution disparities increases at the highest SAT score range (1310-1600), partly driven by the relatively fewer number of first-generation college students included within these orders. Again, the City of Chicago Geomarket disproportionately contributes a disproportionate share of first-generation Asian college students (43% across both parental education categories) and first-generation Hispanic college students (52% across both parental education categories) in comparison to the overall distribution of first-generation college students within each racial/ethnic category (13% for Asian and 40% for Hispanic, respectively). Conversely, nearly all other Geomarkets contribute a disproportionately larger share of non-first generation college students across all racial/ethnic categories. -->
```
For instance, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race shows the nearly 1,000 Black students whose contact information was purchased in these middle SAT score orders were largely contributed to the overall pool by the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs. These two Geomarkets contributed disproportionately higher shares, 48% and 30%, respectively, compared to their overall contributions of 17% and 20% of all included prospects. On the other hand, all other Geomarkets contributed substantially smaller shares of Black prospects. The City of Chicago Geomarket also contributed larger shares of the nearly 3,000 Hispanic students (39% versus 17% for all prospects), while all other Geomarkets contributed comparable or relatively smaller proportions of Hispanic prospects than their overall representation among all included prospects.

In contrast, these representational patterns by Geomarket are reversed for White and Asian students. @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race shows nearly all Geomarkets contributed to the pool of White prospects at rates proportional to their overall contributions to all included prospects (except City of Chicago). Similar patterns are observed for Asian students, with proportional contributions by Geomarket largely consistent with their overall distribution, except for Northwest Suburbs (19% versus 13% for all prospects) and Evanston and Skokie (10% versus 5% for all prospects) contributing disproportionately larger shares and the South and Southwest Suburbs (8% versus 10% for all prospectq8s) contributing smaller shares relative to their overall contribution to the larger prospect pool.

<!--# One exception is the City of Chicago Geomarket, which contributed only 7% of White prospects, despite accounting for 17% of all included prospects. On the other hand, Western Suburbs and South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarkets 32% and 23% of White prospects while only accounting for 28% and 20% of all included prospects, respectively.  -->

<!--# MOVED THIS UP In contrast, these representational patterns are reversed for Black and Hispanic prospects in @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race. Among the nearly 1,000 Black students included in these orders, the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs contributed disproportionately higher shares, 48% and 30%, respectively, compared to their overall contributions of 17% and 20% of all included prospects, whereas all other Geomarkets contributed substantially smaller proportions of Black prospects. The City of Chicago Geomarket also contributed larger shares of the nearly 3,000 Hispanic students (39% versus 17% for all prospects), while all other Geomarkets contributed comparable or relatively smaller proportions of Hispanic prospects than their overall representation among all included prospects.  -->

These contribution patterns by race/ethnicity demonstrate that student list orders targeting prospects in the Chicago metropolitan area using Geomarket filters that exclude the City of Chicago– as observed in some orders collected via our public requests – result in the loss of substantially disproportionate shares of Black and Hispanic students from the resulting prospect pools. Appendix \@fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-race and @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-race show that this pattern holds across both lower-range (1020-1150) and higher-range (1310-1600) SAT score filters. In both cases, the City of Chicago contributes disproportionately larger shares of Black and Hispanic prospects compared to all other Geomarkets. <!--# [REVISE THESE SENTENCES TO HAMMER THE LEDE -- IF WE EXCLUDE CITY OF CHICAGO GEOMAREKT, THE WAY THE ASU ORDER DOES, WE LOSE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS] -->

We also examine the contributions of each Geomarket to the pool of prospects based on first-generation college student status. Similar to race/ethnicity figures above, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses presents the Geomarket distribution for the 13,749 total prospects (whose first-generations status is known) included in middle-range SAT score orders (1160-1300). Among the 1,743 prospects whose parents did not attend college ("no college"), the City of Chicago stands out as the only Geomarket contributing a disproportionately larger share of first-generation college students - 38% in comparison to 17% for all included prospects in this SAT range. In contrast, all other Geomarkets contributed disproportionately smaller shares of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college relative to all included prospects, with such disparity ranging from a one-percentage-point difference (South and Southwest Suburbs) to a nine-percentage-point difference (Western Suburbs). For prospects whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degrees ("some college"), @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses indicates both City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarkets contribute a disproportionately larger share of first-generation students. These representational patterns are reversed among prospects that are not first-generation college students. The City of Chicago Geomarket contributed a substantially smaller share of not-first generation prospects (12%) relative to all prospects (17%) in this SAT range, whereas all other Geomarkets contributed comparable shares.

Relative to @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses, appendix figures \@fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-ses and @fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-ses demonstrate Geomarket contribution patterns by first-generation college student status are less pronounced in low-SAT range orders (1020-1150) and more pronounced in high-range SAT orders (1310-1600), respectively.

Finally, we examine Geomarket contributions to prospect pools by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity in the Chicago metropolitan area. @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo presents the Geomarket distribution of the 12,981 total prospects (whose first-generation status and race/ethnicity is known) included in middle-range SAT (1160-1300) orders. @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo shows the City of Chicago Geomarket consistently contributes a disproportionately larger share of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college across all racial/ethnic categories. For instance, among all Asian prospects (n=1,341) whose contact information was purchased in this SAT score range, approximately 12% were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 16% were first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree, and 72% were not first-generation college students. @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo shows the City of Chicago disproportionately contributes 35% of all Asian first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college. For first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but never completed degrees, City of Chicago (22%), South and Southwest Suburbs (20%), and Evanston and Skokie (20%) Geomarkets contributed larger shares of Asian prospects.

Similar Geomarket contribution patterns are evident among Hispanic prospects. The City of Chicago Geomarket stands out as the only Geomarket contributing substantially larger shares of Hispanic first-generation college students across those whose parents did not attend college (46% versus 38% overall) and those whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degrees (29% versus 26% overall). Although Black prospects who are not first-generation college students make up a relatively smaller portion of the overall pool, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo suggests that such prospects are primarily contributed by the Evanston and Skokie, City of Chicago, and Western Surburbs Geomarkets.

Lastly, although Black prospects who are not first-generation college students make up a relatively smaller portion of the overall pool, @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo suggests that such prospects are primarily contributed by the Evanston and Skokie, City of Chicago, and Western Surburbs Geomarkets. Similarly, Geomarkets such as Chain of Lakes, North Shore, Evanston and Skokie, and Western Surburbs contribute a disproportionately larger share of White prospects who are not first-generation college students, whereas City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs contribute larger shares of White first-generation college students.

<!--# OLD WHITE PROSPECT TEXT among all White prospects (n=8,155) whose contact information was purchased in this SAT score range, approximately 6% were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 15% were first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree, and 79% were not first-generation college students. @fig-chicago-rq2-midSAT-combo shows the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs Geomarkets disproportionately contribute larger shares of White first-generation college students who parents did not attend college (10% and 9%, respectively). For first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but never completed degrees, only the South and Southwest Suburbs (25%) Geomarket contributed a substantially larger share of White prospects. In contrast, Geomarkets such as Chain of Lakes (82%), North Shore (94%), Evanston and Skokie (81%), and Western Surburbs (84%) contribute a disproportionately larger share of White prospects who are not first-generation college students. -->

Appendix figures @fig-chicago-rq2-lowSAT-combo and \@fig-chicago-rq2-highSAT-combo show the magnitude of these Geomarket contribution disparities become more pronounced at as SAT score thresholds increase.

The enduring segregated structure of the Chicago metropolitan area from 1980 to 2020 analyzed above plays a significant role in how Geomarkets shape the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition of prospect pools. Reflecting the larger metropolitan area dynamics, central Geomarkets that are predominantly comprised of low-income communities of color such as the City of Chicago and South and Southwest Suburbs consistently contribute disproportionately larger shares of Black, Hispanic, and first-generation college prospects, especially at lower SAT score thresholds. On the other hand, predominantly White and affluent Geomarkets in the suburban ring of the metropolitan area like the Chain of Lakes, North Shore, and Evanston and Skokie contribute larger proportions of White and Asian prospects, as well as non-first generation college students. However, the City of Chicago stands out in playing crucial role in fostering college access for first-generation Asian and Hispanic college students, contributing such prospects to the overall pool at significantly higher, disproportionate rates than any other Geomarket. Given the broader racial/ethnic distribution of the Chicago metropolitan area, student list orders that use Geomarket filters excluding the City of Chicago and including more affluent Geomarkets in targeting high-achieving students may still capture some Asian and Hispanic prospects. However, these students are far more unlikely to be first-generation students of color.

## Dallas-Fort Worth

### Suburban Geomarket Growth Eases Racial Disparities, Concentrated Wealth Persists

The six Geomarkets within the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area are illustrated in @fig-dallas-maps by total population across the three census periods. The Dallas-Fort Worth region represents a unique "metroplex" case formed by the convergence of two separate metropolitan areas, which creates a unique urban spatial structure that differs from the classic urban core and suburban ring model showcased by Chicago. As depicted in @fig-dallas-maps, two distinct inner-core Geomarkets (City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth) are seperated by a centrally located suburban Geomarket encompassing Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie. These central Geomarkets are surrounded by the more conventional outer ring of suburban Geomarkets (Dallas County, Collin and Rockwall Counties, and West of Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex).

From 1980 to 2020, the population of the overall Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area increased substantially from approximately 2.7 Million to 6.8 Million. @fig-dallas-maps shows all six Geomarkets experienced population growth over the three census periods. However, the most pronounced increases occured in the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and Collin & Rockwall Counties Geomarkets, which grew from approximately 340,000 to 1.4 Million and 170,000 to 1.2 Million, respectively. These population trends, as shown in @fig-dallas-maps, suggest population growth has been partly driven by urban sprawl from the metropolitan centers - City of Forth Worth and City of Dallas - into the surrounding suburban and rural areas of the metropolitan areas. This outward expansion may also account for the comparatively larger geographic size of the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarket from 1980 to 2000.

<!--#  [WRITING IS QUITE GOOD!I THINK THERE IS A MODEST LEAD THAT THE NEXT COUPLE PARAGRAPHS DON'T STRESS ENOUGH , WHICH IS THAT TX19/CITY OF DALLAS IS THE MOST LEAST WHITE/ASIAN AND THE POOREST]--> @fig-dallas-rq1-race presents the racial and ethnic composition of each Geomarket within the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area across the three census periods. In 1980, all Geomarkets were predominantly White, with White populations ranging from 62% in City of Dallas to nearly 92% in West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. By 2000, however, Geomarkets located in the central part of the metropolitan area exhibited a more balanced racial/ethnic distribution, including Dallas County (58% White, 16% Black, 19% Hispanic; 6% Asian), Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie (54% White, 12% Black, 26% Hispanic; 16% Asian), and City of Fort Worth (57% White, 16% Black, 22% Hispanic; 3% Asian). In contrast, Collin & Rockwall Counties and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarkets remained predominantly White in 2000 at 78% and 80%, respectively.

By 2000, the City of Dallas was no longer a predominantly White Geomarket, with a population that was approximately 24% Black, 30% Hispanic, and 3% Asian. Over the next two decades, the Hispanic population grew steadily, contributing to greater diversity. By 2020, the City of Dallas Geomarket had the lowest proportions of White and Asian residents across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan area, with approximately 21% Black, 38% Hispanic, and 2% Asian residents.

These shifts in racial and ethnic composition also became more pronounced for other Geomarkets between 2000 and 2020. The Collin and Rockwall and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarkets experienced continued declines in their share of White residents. However, both Geomarkets remained predominantly White (58% and 63%, respectively). In contrast, all other Geomarkets experienced continued increases in the shares of Black and Hispanic residents, resulting in a diminished previously White-majority populations for Dallas County (33% White, 23% Black, 32% Hispanic; 9% Asian), Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie (30% White, 20% Black, 36% Hispanic; 12% Asian), and City of Fort Worth (46% White, 15% Black, 33% Hispanic; 4% Asian). <!--#  Lastly, continuous increases in the shares of Black and Hispanic residents further diversified the City of Dallas, making it the most racially/ethnically diverse Geomarket in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. -->

<!--# [CITY OF DALLAS!] --> Socioeconomic demographics of median income, percent living below poverty, and educational attainment over time are presented in @fig-dallas-rq1-ses for the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Overall, median income both within and across Geomarkets remained relatively stable across the three census periods. Between 1980 to 2000, affluence levels across Geomarkets were consistent, ranging from a low of \$82,000 in City of Fort Worth to a high of \$135,00 in the Collin & Rockwall Counties Geomarket. However, the substantial increase in median income for the Collin & Rockwall Counties Geomarket during this time period plateaued by 2020, reshuffling relatively affluence levels among Geomarkets. By 2020, Collin & Rockwall Counties remained the most affluent Geomarket with a median household income of \$133,000, followed by West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex (\$116,000), and Dallas County (\$90,000).

In contrast, median household income for City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth remained relatively stable through 2020. As a result, both City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth continued to rank at the lowest levels of affluence within the metropolitan area at \$86,000 and \$87,000 median household incomes, respectively. @fig-dallas-rq1-ses also illustrates changes in the percentage of residents living in poverty and educational attainment within Geomarkets over time, revealing similar dynamics across Geomarkets to those observed in median household income. Together, these trends underscore the growingly racial/ethnic diverse but widening economic inequality within the evolving Geomarket landscape of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

<!--#  [DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED PARAGRAPH ON POVERTY + EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT] @fig-dallas-rq1-ses also illustrates changes in the percentage of residents living in poverty within Geomarkets over time, revealing shifting dynamics across Geomarkets similar to those observed in median household income. Together, these trends underscore the growingly racial/ethnic diverse but widening economic inequality within the evolving Geomarket landscape of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In 1980, poverty rates were comparably low in both Collin & Rockwall Counties and Dallas County, moderate in the Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prarie and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarkets, and highest for City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth Geomarkets. Overtime, poverty rates declined in Collin & Rockwall Counties and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, while increasing for all other Geomarkets. These divergent trends resulted in a widening gap in poverty levels across the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. A similar widening disparity is evident in educational attainment. Although all Geomarkets experienced increases in the percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher between 1980 and 2020, the Collin & Rockwall Counties Geomarket experienced a substantially greater increase - from 23% in 1980 to 50% in 2020- maintaining the gap with other Geomarkets in terms of educational attainment. .-->

<!--#  [DON'T THINK YOU NEED SUMMARY PARAGRAPHS LIKE THIS WITHIN SECTIONS FOR THIS METRO]The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex experienced substantial demographic growth since Geomarket boundaries were dilineated by @RN4982 in the early 1980s, leading to an urban landscape with considerable racial/ethnic diversity across multiple Geomarkets (as opposed to concentrated within a single Geomarket like Chicago) but stark socioeconomic disparities between Geomarkets. While all six Geomarkets experienced population increases, the most significant growth occurred in the outer suburban areas, reflecting ongoing urban sprawl. Such growth is largely attributed to increases in Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations leading to only two of the six Dallas-Fort Worth Geomarkets remaining predominantly White (Collin and Rockwall Counties and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. On the other hand, the metropolitan area has experienced widening disparities in income, poverty, and education attainment between Geomarkets, especially between the historically affluent Collin and Rockwall Counties and the less economically advantaged inner-core Geomarkets (City of Fort Worth and City of Dallas). Together, these trends underscore the growingly racial/ethnic diverse but widening economic inequality within the evolving Geomarket landscape of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. -->

### Composition of Students Lists by Geomarkets

We also analyze student list orders collected through public requests to assess how the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition of included versus excluded prospects varies when filtering on particular Geomarkets within the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Specifically, we analyze three list orders placed by a research university targeting prospects across 87 different Geomarkets nationwide, including all six Geomarkets in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan area. Each order also filtered for prospects in the 2019-2020 graduating class and based on PSAT scores across three ranges: 1070-1180, 1190-1260, and 1270-1520. Similar to Chicago analyses, we focus on prospects within the middle PSAT score range (1190-1260) from the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area to simulate Geomarket contributions and assess patterns of inclusion versus exclusion.

@fig-dallas-rq2-race presents the racial/ethnic composition of purchased student profiles within Geomarkets in the Dallas-Forthworth area, revealing a comparatively more distributed pattern of racial/ethnic diversity across Geomarkets unlike Chicago's concentrated diversity within a single Geomarket. This distribution is most notable at the lowest PSAT score threshold. For instance, at the 1070-1180 PSAT score range, the central suburban Geomarkets of Dallas County (36% White, 17% Asian, 15% Black, 28% Hispanic) and Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie (34% White, 13% Asian, 15% Black, 34% Hispanic) have the greatest proportions of non-White prospects, which is largely attributed to their greater shares of Asian and Black prospects. While the urban central Geomarkets of City of Dallas and City of Fortworth are the most racially/ethnically diverse in the larger metropolitan area (see @fig-dallas-rq1-race), their prospect pools in @fig-dallas-rq2-race includes larger proportions of Hispanic prospects but lower proportions of Asian and Black students. The Collin & Rockwall Counties (57% White, 7% Black, 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian) and West of Dallas/Forth Worth Metroplex Geomarkets (61% White, 7% Black, 19% Hispanic, 7% Asian) both yield the largest but predominantly White prospect pools.

<!--# which most closely mirror the overall demographic makeup of the metropolitan area in 2020 (see @fig-dallas-rq1-race). For example,  the Dallas County (36% White, 17% Asian, 15% Black, 28% Hispanic) and the Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie (34% White, 13% Asian, 15% Black, 34% Hispanic) Geomarkets have the greatest proportions of non-White prospects although yielding smaller overall pools. Interestingly, while the City of Dallas is the most racially/ethnically diverse Geomarket in the larger metropolitan area, its prospect pool in @fig-dallas-rq2-race includes larger proportion of Hispanic (41%) prospects but lower proportions of Asian (4%) and Black (9%) students comparatively. -->

Prospect pools within Geomarkets from the middle range PSAT score (1190-1260) to the high PSAT score range (1270-1520) become disproportionately more Asian, while the representation of Hispanic and Black prospects decline substantially. <!--OZAN CUT THIS TEXT 5/13. THINKING NOT ESSENTIAL. AND NOT SO SURE IF IT SHOWS THAT. Such shifts also shift distribution patterns of racial/ethnic diversity across Geomarkets, making City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth critical Geomarkets for including Black and Hispanic students from the resulting prospect pools. \[KS LEFT OFF HERE} -->

@fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-race presents the race/ethnicity of all prospects targeted in the middle PSAT score range across Geomarket contributions. The bars for "All (race known)" show that Collin & Rockwall (37%) and West of Dallas/Forth Worth (23%) contribute many more students than the other four Geomarkets. Disparities in Geomarket contributions were evident but differed for Asian, Black, and Hispanic students. For instance, The Dallas County (20% versus 13% for all prospects) and Colin and Rockwall Counties (47% versus 37% for all prospects) Geomarkets contributed a disproportionate larger share of Asian students, whereas nearly all other Geomarkets contributed disproportionately smaller shares.

<!--# @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-race shows nearly all Geomarkets contributed to the pool of White prospects at rates nearly proportional to their overall contributions to all included prospects, with the exception of the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarket contributing a disproportionately larger share (29% versus 23% for all prospects).  -->

Representational patterns across Geomarkets are reversed for Black and Hispanic prospects in @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-race. All Geomarkets besides Collin and Rockwall Counties and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex contributed equal or larger proportions of Black and Hispanic prospects relative to their contributions to the overall prospect pool in the Dallas-Fort Woth metropolitan area. However, the City of Dallas Geomarket contributed the largest disproportionate share of Hispanic prospects (19% versus 11% for all prospects), whereas the Dallas Counties Geomarket contributed the largest disproportionate share of Black prospects (21% versus 13% for all prospects).

Contributions of each Geomarket to the pool of prospects based on first-generation college student status from the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area are presented in @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-ses. Only 303 prospects of the 3,928 total in this middle PSAT score range pool were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college. Again, all Geomarkets besides Collin and Rockwall Counties (14% versus 36% for all prospects) and West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex (15% versus 24% for all prospects) contributed equal or larger proportions of first-generation college students (no college) relative to their contributions to the overall prospect pool. Disproportioantely larger contributions range from six percentage points by the Dallas Counties Geomarket (19% versus 13% for all prospects) to 11 percentage points by the City of Dallas Geomarket (22% versus 11% for all prospects). Contributions become more proportional for the pool of first-generation college students whose parents attended but did not complete their degree. Proportional balances across Geomarkets are also evident for the 3,069 prospects that are not first-generation college students, with the exception of Collin and Rockwall Counties Geomarket contributing the largest disproportionate share of not first-generation college students (40%) relative to the contributions to the overall prospect pool (36%).

Lastly, @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-combo presents Geomarket contributions to prospect pools by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity, which we view as the most interesting results for the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Among all White prospects (n=2,094) whose contact information was purchased in this middle PSAT score range, approximately 3% were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 11% were first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree, and 86% were not first-generation college students. @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-combo shows nearly all Geomarkets contribute a nearly proportionate share of prospects by first-generation college students relative to the overall pool, the only modest exception being the Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie Geomarket.

By contrast, for non-White groups, a larger share of prospects were first-generation students. Furthermore, first generation status differed substantially across Geomarkets, especially for Hispanic and Asian students. For Hispanic students, more than 50% of prospects from the City of Dallas, City of Forth Worth, Arlington & Grand Prairie, and Dallas County are first-generation college students. By contrast, for the more affluent Collin & Rockwall Geomarket and the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarkets, less than 30% of prospects were first-generation. For Asian prospects, City of Fort Worth and Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie Geomarkets contributed disproportionately larger shares of first-generation college students across both parents with no college and some college. By contrast, the more affluent Collin & Rockwall sent more Asian prospects (285) than any other Geomarket, but about 87% of these prospects were not first-generation college students.

<!-- I ADDED THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH AND CUT THIS PARAGRAPH TO GIVE THE LEDE MORE PUNCH 
Similar patterns of one or two Geomarkets disproportionately contributing larger shares of first-generation college students was evident across other racial/ethnic categories in @fig-dallas-rq2-midSAT-combo. For instance, City of Dallas (18%) and City of Fort Worth (24%) contributed larger proportions of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college relative to the overall pool of all prospects (8%). On the other hand, the Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie (23%) and Dallas Counties (26%) Geomarkets contributed disproportionately larger proportions of Black students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree relative to the overall pool of all prospects (17%). For Asian prospects, City of Fort Worth and Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie Geomarkets contributed disproportionately larger shares of first-generation college students across both parents with no college and some college. City of Dallas (38%), City of Fort Worth (39%), Irving, Arlington, & Grand Prairie (32%), Dallas Counties (28%) all contributed larger shares of Hispanic students whose parents did not attend college relative to the overall prospect pool of these first-generation college students (23%), whereas only Dallas Counties contributed to larger shares of Hispanic students who parents attended some college but did not attain their degree (26% versus 20% for all prospects).

Analyses of student list orders across the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area reveals patterns of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic stratification in Geomarket contributions. As Dallas-Fort Worth became increasingly diverse from 1980 to 2020, a more balanced racial/ethnic distribution emerged across the metropolitan area's Geomarket landscape. However, these patterns did not translate to racial/ethnic composition of student prospect pools. Suburban Geomarkets like Collin and Rockwall Counties and the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex yielded a disproportionately larger share of Asian prospects, whereas central Geomarkets such as the City of Dallas, Dallas County, and Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie contributed a disproportionately larger share of Hispanic and Black prospects. These racial/ethnic disparities become significantly more pronounced, particularly in the disproportionate share of Asian prospects, as PSAT score thresholds increase (see Appendix @fig-dallas-rq2-lowSAT-race and @fig-dallas-rq2-highSAT-race). Similar Geomarket contribution patterns are also evident by first-generation college student status, with Collin and Rockwall Counties and the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex providing larger shares of non-first generation college student prospects, and central Geomarkets (City of Dallas, City of Fort Worth, Dallas County, and Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie) providing disproportionately larger shares of first-generation college student prospects. Moreover, central Geomarkets are particularly important for including Black (City of Dallas and City of Fort Worth), Hispanic (City of Dallas, City of Fort Worth, Dallas County, and Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie), and Asian (City of Fort Worth and Irving, Arlington, and Grand Prairie) first-generation college students. While Collin and Rockwall Counties and the West of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Geomarkets still contribute a notable overall number of Black, Hispanic, and Asian prospects, such students are predominantly not first-generation college students.

## Los Angeles

### Decentralized Diversity and Income in a Multi-Nucleo Landscape

Due to the large number of Geomarkets in urban Southern California, we distinguish Los Angeles -- 11 Geomarkets, results shown here -- from Orange County (four Geomarkets) and San Diego (three Geomarkets), which are shown in the Online Appendix. The 11 Geomarkets within the Los Angeles metropolitan area are illustrated in @fig-la-maps by total population across the three census periods. The Los Angeles metropolitan area is one of the only multi-nuclei models in the country that is formed when urban growth occurs around multiple centers that serve different functions rather than expanding from a single central business district core (CITE- Harris and Ullman 1945). As depicted in @fig-la-maps, Geomarkets closely follow this overall metropolitan model. Hollywood and Wilshire, South and South Central Los Angeles, and East Los Angeles Geomarkets are centrally located in the metropolitan area followed by an outer core ring of made up by the Glendale and Pasadena, San Fernando Valley-East, West Los Angeles and West Beach, South Bay, and Long Beach Geomarkets. The San Fernando Valley-West Geomarket is located in the northwest part of the region, whereas Covina and West Covina as well as the Riverside, San Bernadino, and Ontario Geomarkets are located inland, comprising the Inland Empire.

The population growth in the Los Angeles metropolitan area increased from approximately 8 Million in 1980 to more than 12 Million in 2020. @fig-dallas-maps showcases population growth by Geomarkets over the three census periods reflect the urban sprawl forming the multi-nuclei model. The most pronounced increases occurred in South and South Central Los Angeles Geomarket, as well as the outer/inland Geomarkets of San Fernando Valley-West, Riverside and San Bernadino, and Ontario. The South and South Central Los Angeles Geomarket grew from approximately 1.2 to 1.6 Million from 1980 to 2020. In contrast, the San Fernando Valley-West and Riverside and San Bernadino, and Ontario Geomarkets grew from approximately 700,000 to 1.2 Million and from 1.1 Million to nearly 3 Million during this time, respectively.

\@fig-la-rq1-race presents the racial and ethnic composition of each Geomarket within the Los Angeles metropolitan area from 1980 to 2020. Over this period, the proportion of White residents declined across all Geomarkets, while Asian and Hispanic populations generally increased. \[THE CAVEAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ASIAN FOR 1980 IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR LA\] In 1980, all Geomarkets - except for East Los Angeles, South and South Central Los Angeles, and Hollywood and Wilshire- were predominantly White, with percentages ranging from 62% White in Long Beach to 78% in the San Fernando Valleys (West and East) Geomarkets. By 2020, however, only the West Los Angeles and West Beach Geomarket remained predominantly White (62%). Remanining Geomarkets exhibited a more racially/ethnic diverse population by 2020, including San Fernando Valley-West- (44% White, 4% Black, 39% Hispanic; 11% Asian Pacific Islander), San Fernando Valley -East (43% White, 4% Black, 41% Hispanic; 8% Asian Pacific Islander), Glendale and Pasadena (35% White, 3% Black, 37% Hispanic; 21% Asian Pacific Islander), South Bay (29% White, 12% Black, 33% Hispanic; 21% Asian Pacific Islander), Long Beach (26% White, 11% Black, 46% Hispanic; 13% Asian Pacific Islander), Covina and West Covina (19% White, 3% Black, 52% Hispanic; 24% Asian Pacific Islander), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (28% White, 7% Black, 54% Hispanic; 6% Asian Pacific Islander). However, the South and South Central Los Angeles and Hollywood and Wilshire Geomarkets experienced substantial declines in the share of Black residents from 1980 to 2020, dropping from 44% to 18% and 18% to 9%, respectively.

\[I THINK THE LEADS ARE THAT SOUTH CENTRAL (ESPECIALLY), EAST LA, AND WILSHIRE ARE THE POOREST. START TEHRE AND THEN GET TO OTHER RESULTS.\] @fig-la-rq1-ses presents trends in socioeconomic indicators for the Los Angeles metropolitan area from 1980 to 2020. While median income increased across all of the metropolitan area over the three census periods, some shifts occurred in the relative socioeconomic levels across Geomarkets. Many Geomarkets kept their relative levels of affluence from 1980 to 2020. For instance, the Covina and West Covina, South Bay, and San Fernando Valley remained among the most affluent, whereas the San Fernando Valley East, Glendale and Pasadena, Long Beach, and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario Geomarkets remained at middle ranges of affluence and the Hollywood and Wilshire, South and South Central Los Angeles, and East Los Angeles Geomarkets remained at the lowest levels of affluence across the metropolitan area during this period. The West Los Angeles and West Beach Geomarket demonstrated the most substantial increase in median household income, rising from \$112,000 in 1980 to \$132,000 in 2000, and reaching \$137,000 by 2020. This sustained growth positioned it as the most affluent Geomarket in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

@fig-la-rq1-ses also illustrates shifting levels of poverty across Geomarkets in the Los Angeles metropolitan area over time. In 1980, poverty rates were relatively low (less than 12%) for all Geomarkets except for East Los Angeles (17%), South and South Central Los Angeles (24%), and Hollywood and Wilshire (18%). However, poverty rates declined in South and South Central Los Angeles (22%), remained stable in East Los Angeles and Hollywood and Wilshire, and increased in all other Geomarkets. Such shifts and West of Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex, while increasing for all other Geomarkets. These divergent trends resulted in more staggered poverty rates across the metropolitan area by 2020. This includes four Geomarkets with poverty rates less than 10% (San Fernando Valley- West, West Los Angeles and West Beach, South Bay, and Covina and West Covina), four Geomarkets with poverty rates ranging from 11%-15% (San Fernando Valley- East, Glendale and Pasadena, Long Beach, and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario), and three Geomarkets with poverty rates ranging from 16%-22% (Hollywood and Wilshire, East Los Angeles, South and South Central Los Angeles).

Lastly, @fig-la-rq1-ses shows a widening disparity in educational attainment across the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Although all Geomarkets experienced increases in the percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher between 1980 and 2020, the West Los Angeles and West Beach Geomarket experienced a substantially greater increase - from 35% in 1980 to 66% in 2020- widening the gap with other Geomarkets in terms of educational attainment.

\[THINK YOU CAN CUT THIS PARAGRAPH\] The Los Angeles metropolitan area exemplifies a complex multi-nuclei urban model, characterized by decentralized population growth and increasing demographic diversity across its 11 Geomarkets. From 1980 to 2020, the region’s population expanded significantly leading to overall declines in the White population and increases in Hispanic and Asian populations across Geomarkets. West Los Angeles and West Beach is the only majority White Geomarket in 2020. Socioeconomic indicators reveal enduring disparities, especially in historically lower-income Geomarkets like South and South Central Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, and Hollywood and Wilshire. Meanwhile, Geomarkets such as West Los Angeles and West Beach became increasingly affluent and highly educated, highlighting growing socioeconomic and educational divides. Given these demographic shifts within the context of a multi-nuclei urban model, the Los Angeles metropolitan area presents a distinctive Geomarket landscape case in which racial/ethnic enclaves across a range of various socioeconomic levels are distributed across multiple Geomarkets rather than concentrated in one or two.

### Composition of Students Lists by Geomarkets

To examine how the socioeconomic and racial composition of included versus excluded prospects varies when student list purchases filter on particular Geomarkets in the Los Angeles metropolitan areas, we analyze six orders placed by a research university that filtered for prospects across the entire state of California, in the 2019-2020 \[NOT JUST 2019-20. REVISE\] high school graduating class, and by PSAT scores. Two orders indicated PSAT score thresholds ranging from 1070-1180, another two orders filtered for a 1190-1260 PSAT range, and the remaining two orders filtered for scores ranging from 1270-1520.

@fig-la-rq2-race presents the racial/ethnic composition of purchased student profiles. The more than 15,000 prospects in the resulting student lists at the low PSAT score thresholds (1070-1180) reflect very similar racial/ethnic compositions within Geomarkets than overall demographic makeup of the metropolitan area in 2020 (see @fig-la-rq1-race). \[THE LEDE IS SOUTH CENTRAL AND EAST LA. START THERE!\]. However, the racial/ethnic composition of prospects become less proportional to overall metropolitan patterns by Geomarket as PSAT scores increase. For instance, prospect pools at middle range PSAT scores (1190-1260) within Geomarkets become disproportionately more Asian, while the representation of Hispanic and Black prospects decline substantially. This pattern becomes most pronounced at the highest PSAT score prospect pools. \[I DON'T THINK THAT BLACK AND LATINX STUDENTS HAVING LOW TEST SCORES IS THE STORY WE ARE TRYING TO TELL. THAT STORY HAS BEEN TOLD. THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS, WITHIN SOME TEST THRESHOLD, HOW DOES THE RACIAL COMPOSITION VARY ACROSS GEOMARKETS. LIKE EVEN WITHIN THE MID RANGE, SOUTH CENTRAL, EAST LA, AND INLAND EMPIRE STAND OUT\] <!-- This disproportionate over representation for Asian prospects in comparison to the population of residents with Geomarkets ranges from 3 percentage points in the West Los Angeles and West Beach Geomarket (16% prospects versus 13% Asian residents) to 52 percentage points in the East Los Angeles Geomarket (79% prospects versus 27% residents). @fig-la-rq2-race illustrates the share of Black prospects within these high PSAT orders declines to less than 3% within all Geomarkets in comparison to Black residents making up a range of 3% (Covina and West Covina) to 18% (South and South Central Los Angeles) of residents within Geomarkets. Similar underrepresentation patterns are evident for Hispanic porspects are evident across all Geomarkets execept for a nearly equal representation in South and South Central Los Angeles (73% prospects versus 71% Hispanic residents). -->

@fig-la-rq2-midSAT-race presents the race/ethnicity of all prospects targeted in the middle PSAT score range across Geomarket contributions for the Los Angeles metropolitan area. For the more than 2,500 White prospects in this pool, we see the San Fernando Valley - West (28% versus 20% for all prospects) and the West Los Angeles and West Beach (12% versus 7% for all prospects)Geomarkets contributing disproportionately larger shares.

\[I THINK CLEANER IF YOU JUST HAVE A SMALL PARAGRAPH FOR HISPANIC AND A SMALL PARAGRAPH FOR BLACK. I THINK ONE LEDE ACROSS THESE RESULTS IS RIVERSIDE AS AN ENGINE FOR BLACK/LATINX AND FOR FIRST-GEN STUDENTS. I GET THAT THESE TWO POINTS CONTRADICT EACH OTHER\]. Representational patterns across Geomarkets are reversed for Black and Hispanic prospects in @fig-la-rq2-midSAT-race. South and South Central Los Angeles and Riverside, San Bernadino, and Ontario Geomarkets contributed larger proportions of Black and Hispanic prospects relative to their contributions to the overall prospect pool in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. On the other hand, the San Fernando Valley- West and the Glendale and Pasadena Geomarket contributed smaller proportions of Black and Hispanic Prospects. However, the West Los Angeles and West Beach (10% versus 7% for all prospects), Hollywood Wilshire (7% versus 5% for all prospects), and the Long Beach (8% versus 5% for all prospects) Geomarkets contributed a larger share of Black prospects, whereas Covina and West Covina contributed a larger share of Hispanic students. All other Geomarkets contributed nearly equal shares of Black and Hispanic prospects.

\[I MOVED ASIAN\] For Asian students, the Glendale and Pasadena (17% versus 14% for all prospects), East Los Angeles (11% versus 5% for all prospects) and Covina and West Covina (17% versus 11% for all prospects) Geomarkets contributed a disproportionate larger shares, whereas nearly all other Geomarkets contributed disproportionately smaller or nearly equal shares.

Contributions of each Geomarket to the pool of prospects from the Los Angeles metropolitan area based on first-generation college student status are presented in @fig-la-rq2-midSAT-ses [THIS SENTENCE IS UGLY. MAKE IT MORE LIKE FIG X SHOWS THE CONTRIBUTIONS EACH GEOMARKET MAKES BY FIRST GENERATION STATUS GROUP]. Only 889 of the more than 8,000 total prospects (11%) in this middle PSAT score range (1190-1260) pool were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college. \[I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU ARE GETTING THESE NUMBERS FROM; THIS IS THE WRONG FIGURE I THINK. AND WHEN YOU REVISE, THE LEDES ARE RIVSERSIDE, EAST LA AND, SOUTH CENTRAL (ONLY 2% OF PROSPECTS BUT 10% OF NO-COLLEGE)\]. Only three of the 11 Geomarkets contributed substantially larger shares of these first-generation prospects: East Los Angeles (35%), South and South Central Los Angeles (47%), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (15%). However, disproportionate contributions become more spread across Geomarkets for the nearly 1,436 of the more than 8,000 total prospects (18%) who were first-generation college students whose parents attended but did not complete their degree. Overall, six of the 11 Geomarkets contributed larger shares of these prospects: Hollywood & Wilshire (25%), East Los Angeles (26%), South and South Central Los Angeles (28%), Long Beach (25%), Covina and West Covina (22%), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (22%). This leads to the remaining Geomarkets - San Fernando Valley- West (80%), San Fernando Valley- East (78%), Glendale and Pasadena (77%), West Los Angeles & West Beach (87%), South Bay (81%) - contributing disproportionately larger shares of not first-generation college students relative to the overall prospect pool (71%).

[I THINK THE WAY YOU WRITE UP THIS FIGURE SHOULD BE CHANGED MORE SUBSTANTIALLY; I ADD SOME COMMENTS BELOW] Lastly, @fig-la-rq2-midSAT-combo presents Geomarket contributions to prospect pools by both first-generation college student status and race/ethnicity in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. [TAKE A TIP FROM THE CRIT QUANT FOLKS; YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED TO START WITH WHITE; REVISE THIS TEXT TO START WITH A PARAGRAPH ON HISPANIC AND A PARAGRAPH ON ASIAN -- OR VICE VERSA; THOSE TWO ARE THE LEAD; AND THEN CAN TALK ABOUT WHITE AND BLACK. ]Among all White prospects (n=2,511) whose contact information was purchased in this middle PSAT score range, approximately 3% were first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 11% were first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degree, and 86% were not first-generation college students. @fig-la-rq2-midSAT-combo shows all Geomarkets contribute a nearly proportionate share of prospects by first-generation college students (across both no college and some college parents) relative to the overall pool. The South and South Central Los Angeles Geomarket stands out as one exception contributing a relatively larger share of White first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college (17%) and whose parent attended some college but did not complete their degree (33%) \[DON'T MENTION THIS; THIS IS 6 STUDENTS!\]. Other Geomarket that contributed signifcantly larger shares of White first-generation prospects whose parents did not complete their degree include Long Beach (17%), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (19%).

[THE LEAD IS EAST LA WHICH HAS 251 ASIAN STUDENTS AND IS WAY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHE IN FIRSTGEN; AND THEN WILSHIRE IS SORTA CLOSE] Geomarkts contributions to first-generation college students was mixed across other racial/ethnic categories in @fig-la-rq2-midSAT-combo. For Asian prospects (11% first-generation no college, 21% first-generation some college, and 68% not first-generation), the Hollywood & Wilshire (12%) and East Los Angeles (36%) Geomarkets contributed larger proportions of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college. The San Fernando Valley- East (28%), Hollywood & Wilshire (35%), East Los Angeles (25%), South and South Central Los Angeles (44%) [ONLY 9 STUDENTS!], Long Beach (27%), and Covina and West Covina (25%) Geomarkets also contributed larger proportions of first-generation college students whose parents attended college but did not complete their their degree.

For Black prospects (5% first-generation no college, 20% first-generation some college, and 74% not first-generation), Geomarkets that disproportionately larger proportions of first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college include South Bay (11%), South and South Central Los Angeles (21%), Long Beach (7%), and Covina and West Covina (9%). The West Los Angeles and West Beach (26%), Hollywood & Wilshire (36%), East Los Angeles (33%), Long Beach (40%), and Covina and West Covina (27%) Geomarkets also contributed larger proportions of Black first-generation college students whose parents attended college but did not complete their their degree.

Finally, Hispanic prospects in this middle range PSAT order were on average 25% first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college, 25% first-generation college students whose parents attended some college but did not complete their degrees, and 50% were not first-generation college students. The Hollywood & Wilshire (30%), East Los Angeles (39%), South and South Central Los Angeles (54%), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (31%) contributed disproportionate shares of Hispanic first-generation college students whose parents did not attend college. The East Los Angeles (33%), South and South Central Los Angeles (28%), Long Beach (30%), and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario (27%) also contributed larger Hispanic first-generation college students whose parents attended college but did not complete their their degree.

\[NOTE SURE YOU NEED THIS PARAGRAPH\]Despite Los Angeles's multi-nuclei urban structure contributing to a more decentralized Geomarket landscape with racial/ethnic diversity across a range of socioeconomic levels more spatially distributed across the metropolitan area, Geomarkets contributions to student prospect pools reflect racial and socioeconomic stratification patterns similar to other metropolitan cases in the study. Affluent Geomarkets like San Fernando Valley–West and West Los Angeles contribute an overrepresentation of White, Asian, and not-first generation college student prospects, the magnitude of which increases substantially as score ranges increase (see Appendix @fig-la-rq2-lowSAT-race and @fig-la-rq2-highSAT-race). On the other hand, more diverse and historically low-income Geomarkets, like South and South Central Los Angeles and Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ontario, contribute disproportionately more Black, Hispanic, and first-generation college student prospects. Similar to Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles further solidifies the pattern of some of the lowest-income Geomarkets consistently playing crucial roles in fostering college access for first-generation Asian (East Los Angeles), Black (South and South Central Los Angeles), and Hispanic college students (South and South Central Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Hollywood and Wilshire, and Riverside, San Berdardino, and Ontario).

# Discussion

In their analysis of quantifying school quality in England, @RN5005 [p. 517] observe that "one problem with school league tables \ldots is that the measures of school quality often merely reflect the social origins of those who attend a particular school." Similarly, considering prior research showing that SAT scores are substantially a function of social origin [@RN1273], the Market Segment Model argues that student demand for higher education is mostly a function of social origin.

Institutional theory defines the organizational field as "those organizations that, in the aggregate, constitute a recognized area of institutional life: key suppliers, resource and product consumers, regulatory agencies, and other organizations that produce similar services and products" [@RN527, p. 143].

# Appendix A

@tbl-market-segment-characteristics reproduces a partial, simplified version of the bottom panel of @RN4982 [Figure 2.1] which represents the Market Segment Profile for "Connecticut Market 3: Fairfield County." @tbl-market-segment-characteristics has separate columns for each market segment (local, in-state, regional, national) and rows show the number of test-takers and characteristics of test-takers. For example, there were 550 "local" students in Fairfield county and these students submitted SAT scores to 2.8 postsecondary institutions on average. By contrast, there were 1,664 "regional" students who submitted test scores to 4.8 institutions on average. For local students, 11.2% had family income greater than \$35,000 and 9% had both parents with a BA. For regional students, 41.9% had family income greater than \$35,000 and 34.0% had both parents with a BA. Each Market Segment Profile also present information about the institutions that students from each segment sent scores to.

@tbl-market-segment-institutions recreates the top panel of @RN4982 [Figure 2.1] for the Fairfield County, CT local market. For example, of the 550 local students, 277 (50.4%) sent scores to institution #1, which was a private master's granting institution. Of the 1,199 in-state students, 757 (63.1) sent scores to institution #1, a public doctoral granting institution, and 515 (43.0%) sent scores to institution #2, a public master's granting institution.

The *Institutional Profile* describes students who send scores to a particular institution and which majors these students are interested in. For each institution, institutional profiles are created separately for students from a particular local market, for all students in a state, or all students in a region. @tbl-sample-institutional-profile reproduces a partial, simplified version of @RN4982 [Figure 2.3], the institutional profile of an anonymous institution for students from Fairfield County, CT. @tbl-sample-institutional-profile shows that 58 in-state students submitted SAT scores to the institution. These 58 students represented 4.8% of the total 1,199 in-state students from Fairfield County. 69 regional students sent scores to the institution, representing 4.1% of all 1,664 regional test-takers. Of these 69 regional students, 35 expressed interest in majoring in the liberal arts. These 35 students represent 7.0% of all regional students from Fairfield County who expressed interest in the liberal arts.

@RN4982 argue that the Institutional Profile and the Market Segment Profile enable admissions officers to know where to look for students and which institutions are competing for those students (p. 25):

> The Institutional Profile and the Market Segment Profile quantify the admission officers' intuitive grasp of market structure. Structure here carries a dual meaning, connoting both the structure of student choice and the structure of institutional competition\ldots This two-sided interpretation furnishes the essential framework for planning by individual colleges and universities\ldots To draw effectively on its own natural constituency, a college not only must contact the "right" kind of students --- that is, students who are predisposed toward that type of institution -- but also must persuade them of its special character. This means knowing the competition as well as the clientele.
